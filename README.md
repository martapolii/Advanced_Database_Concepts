This repository is a work in progress and contains ongoing assignments, lab exercises, and projects for the Advanced Database Concepts course (COMP214) at Centennial College. The course focuses on advanced database topics, including SQL, PL/SQL, and NoSQL systems, and culminates in developing the back-end for a commercial web application.

Current and upcoming work includes:
- Advanced SQL queries (joins, subqueries, aggregation).
- PL/SQL programming: procedures, functions, and triggers.
- MongoDB: CRUD operations and aggregation frameworks.
- Database security and administration basics.
